# Creating-a-Fungible-Token

Challenge21

## Description

Creating a new, ERC-20 compliant fungible token called KaseiCoin. This token will be launched as a crowdsale allowing users to covert test Ether to the new Kasei Coin currency.

This fungible token  will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that I will create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

## Instructions
The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

Step 1 - Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

Step 2 - Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

Step 3 - Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

Step 4 - Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain

Perform a real-world, pre-production test of the crowdsale by deploying the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
Demonstrate the deployed contract in action. (This demonstration is shown in the folloing README section)

Step 5 - Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

## Technologies

This project leverages Remix IDE to build and test smart contracts that are created in Solidity. Using the web version of Remix IDE, there is no need to install any software.

Remix IDE - Open source application for developing, deploying, and administering smart contracts that run in Ethereum-based blockchains.
The following packages and technologies are also used:

OpenZeppelin - A library used for secure smart contract development.

Ganache - Easily runs a personal Ethereum blockchain which can be used to run tests, execuate commands and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

MetaMask - A crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps.
