# Creating-a-Fungible-Token

Challenge21

# Description

Creating a new, ERC-20 compliant fungible token called KaseiCoin. This token will be launched as a crowdsale allowing users to covert test Ether to the new Kasei Coin currency.

The sections of this project are as follows:

Create the KaseiCoin token contract.
Create the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract.
Create the KaseiCoin deployer contract.
Perform a real-world, pre-production test of the crowdsale by deploying the crowdsale to a local blockchain using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
Demonstrate the deployed contract in action. (This demonstration is shown in the folloing README section, Evaluation Evidence.)
